# Lazy-Binary-Search-Tree
JAVA | binary search tree, algorithms, data structures

This project is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree data structure in Java. A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion and deletion of elements in a sorted manner. This implementation includes functionality to print the tree, find the height and size of the tree, insert and delete nodes, find the minimum and maximum value in the tree, and check if a specific value is present in the tree.

# Using the Program
The program expects an input file containing a series of commands, one per line. The commands that are currently supported are:

PrintTree: prints the tree in order
Height: prints the height of the tree
Size: prints the number of nodes in the tree
Insert:<value>: inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
Delete:<value>: deletes the node with the given value from the tree
FindMin: prints the minimum value in the tree
FindMax: prints the maximum value in the tree
Contains:<value>: checks if the tree contains a node with the given value and prints True or False
Each command should be on a separate line in the input file. If a command requires a value, it should be provided after a colon (:) on the same line.
